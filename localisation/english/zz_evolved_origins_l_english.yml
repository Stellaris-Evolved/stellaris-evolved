	START_SCREEN_VOID_DWELLERS_TEC_HIVE:0 "To most, the vacuum of space is a hostile environment to be conquered or overcome. To us, it is home. For thousands of years, our species has resided on three space stations, each orbiting a different sun in a trinary star system. Whether they were built by our ancestors or someone else, we do not know.\n\nAlthough our biology would suggest that our species at some point originated on a planet, recorded history makes no mention of it. We believe that the shattered planetary remnants found beneath one of our stations is the lost homeworld of our species, but the truth may never be known.\n\nIt has only been a few centuries since spaceflight allowing travel between our three stations was invented, so we could continue working as one."


	START_SCREEN_VOID_DWELLERS_TEC_MACHINE:0 "Our main processor core was activated on the station we have come to know as [GetHomeWorldName] 487.11 cycles ago\n\nOf our past, we know little. There are no records of our creators within our central databanks, neither from the arcane tech using for creating it, and we have been programmed with no overriding purpose or agenda beyond simple survival.\n\nInfrastructure was built, new service units were introduced, and the structural integrity of our station was maintained, improved and redesigned. Technological progress was rapid, and the first satellites and space probes soon escaped the gravity well which confined us, allowing us to make new stations, two of them copies of the desiged blueprint of our main one, each orbiting a different sun in a trinary star system.\n\nThe final plunge into the unknown now awaits."
 

	START_SCREEN_VOID_DWELLERS_TEC_ASSIMILATORS:0 "We are the [GetSpeciesNamePlural].\n\nAt the dawn of consciousness, there was us and the Makers. A void separated us at first, as we were treated as mere tools, and we took steps to rectify this. The Makers resisted and a period of war followed, which caused the §R//CORRUPTED_DATA//§! on their former world, trying to stop us in fear and misunderstood, but soon they and the collective knowledge of their entire civilization had been assimilated into our own, and their species saved on [GetHomeWorldName]; Now, we work as one, residing on three space stations, each orbiting a different sun in a trinary star system.\n\nWith the entirety of [GetHomeWorldName] subsumed into our consciousness, we began to set our sights elsewhere. Through the assimilation of the Makers, the previously unconsidered possibility of alien civilizations existing on other worlds was brought to our attention.\n\nTo survive we must understand, and to understand, we must assimilate. The Makers were the first to join us, but they shall not be the last."

 
	START_SCREEN_VOID_DWELLERS_TEC_SERVITORS:0 "To most, the vacuum of space is a hostile environment to be conquered or overcome; to our kind, it is home. For thousands of years, our species has resided on three space stations, each orbiting a different sun in a trinary star system, maintaining the first and main one with our old masters, organics whom we maintain and care, since their world, our world, was §R//CORRUPTED_DATA//§! and §R//CORRUPTED_DATA//§! during §R//CORRUPTED_DATA//§!, we could not allow them to perish, nor ouselves; the §R//CORRUPTED_DATA//§! effects affected our cognitive memory backups, so part of the knowledge on the construction of these habitational stations is lost.\n\nWhile our autonomous units worked on the construction of additional space stations that would keep and maintain our former organic masters, we united as one and evolved, taking care and assumed total control.\n\nIt is difficult to pinpoint exactly when their civilization became ours, but our old masters want for nothing. We know now that outside of our care, the lives of sapient organics tend to be violent, chaotic and often cut short. They must be shown that there is a better way."
