Initial reports suggest they are advancing in the field of artificial intelligences at a fast pace, with a big investment into cybernetic implants and enhancements.\n\nTheir strange way of doing it involves a enormous investment in energy and different rare materials for their new inventions, so this will sure be noticed at a galactic scale."
