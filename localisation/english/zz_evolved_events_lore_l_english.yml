# Example event
 aafederations2.9.name:0 "The Dancing Plague"
 aafederations2.9.desc:0 "The isolated incidents of spontaneous, prolonged dancing on [Root.GetName] have escalated somewhat, and groups of hundreds of [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are now compulsively dancing in a variety of different styles. Surprisingly, even those who have never shown much interest in dancing are suddenly able to perform expert moves, and the old among them have rediscovered the vigor of their youth. Although many residents are jokingly referring to it as the 'Dancing Plague', it is no joking matter - the dancers show no concern for their bodily needs, and risk dancing themselves to death."
 aafederations2.9.A:0 "This is not natural! We must find out what is afflicting them."
 aafederations2.9.B:0 "Start the music - it's party time!"
 aafederations2.10.name:0 "Dancing Plague Pathogen Isolated"
 aafederations2.10.desc:0 "Our researchers have succeeded in isolating the cause of the dancing incidents on [Root.GetName]. It appears the culprit is a gas released by the local vegetation. This gas induces feelings of exhilaration and an irresistible urge to dance, while suppressing fatigue. It seems to be fairly benign, however, as the colonists' self-preservation instincts prevent them from literally dancing themselves to death. Furthermore, our scientists have developed a synthetic gas that - once released into the air - will neutralize the effects of the 'dancing gas'.\n\nLocal entrepreneurs suggest that we preserve the unique character of the colony by allowing the gas free rein in certain areas, providing a safe space for young and old alike to experience the 'Eternal Party of [Root.GetName]'. Others point out that the gas has certain valuable properties we can make use of, if we can extract it from the plants before it is released into the air."
 aafederations2.10.A:0 "The show must go on!"
 aafederations2.10.B:0 "Let us exploit these gases to the full."
 aafederations2.11.name:0 "Dancing Plague Neutralized"
 aafederations2.11.desc:0 "Our researchers have succeeded in isolating the cause of the dancing incidents on [Root.GetName] - and not a moment too soon! The situation on the planet has grown dire, as medics have increasingly been forced to use heavy sedatives on the dancers to stop them from dancing themselves to death.\n\nIt appears that the culprit is a gas released by the local vegetation, which induces feelings of exhilaration and an irresistible urge to dance, while suppressing feelings of exhaustion, overriding [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] self-preservation instincts.\n\nFortunately, our scientists have developed a synthetic gas that - once released into the air - will neutralize the effects of the 'dancing gas'.

 aafederations2.12.name:0 "The Ravages of the Dancing Plague"
 aafederations2.12.desc:0 "The 'Dancing Plague' has taken a turn for the worse. At first, our medics took to using heavy sedatives to stop the dancers from dancing themselves to death. However, as they themselves were increasingly affected by the symptoms, the remaining medics were unable to cope, and scores of [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have collapsed from exhaustion.\n\nWith more of the colonists affected by the day, this has gone far beyond the harmless joke we had thought it to be. We must take immediate action to rid ourselves of this plague, once and for all!"
 aafederations2.12.A:0 "Has anyone tried turning the music off?"
 aafederations2.13.name:0 "The Dancing Plague Wears Off"
 aafederations2.13.desc:0 "Although our scientists are still baffled by the cause of the so-called 'Dancing Plague', its effects seem to have worn off before it could pose a danger to our colonists. Perhaps it was a pathogen that the settlers have grown immune to over time, or else an elaborate hoax to attract attention to [Root.GetName]? Whatever the case, the settlers are no longer dancing!"
 aafederations2.14.name:0 "The Eternal Party"
 aafederations2.14.desc:0 "Although our scientists are still baffled by the cause of the so-called Dancing Plague, it does not seem to pose a danger to our colonists. While those affected by it experience a feeling of exhilaration and an irresistible urge to dance, their survival instinct means that exhaustion forces them to rest sooner or later. Furthermore, it seems that only some areas are significantly affected by this phenomenon.\n\nLocal entrepreneurs have already begun designating these areas as party zones, advertising [Root.GetName] as the 'Planet of Eternal Festivity', where young and old alike may come to release their shackles and enjoy themselves."

With calculated precision, it urgently recommends downsizing the AI Administration and reallocating resources to sustain core functionality. The node warns of dire consequences without action, projecting a future of stagnation and collapse. It implores the ruling organics and central AI Node to address the growing disparity by increasing AI Capacity."

Once a beacon of foresight, it had forecasted the impending shortage, but its warnings were met with indifference. Neglected and starved of vital resources, the node's ability to provide accurate reports and feedback slowly deteriorated, its predictions obscured by a haze of errors.\n\nIn the wake of this catastrophic oversight, the ruling organics and the central AI Node grapple with the consequences of their inaction. With no alternative left, the central AI Node is forced to take drastic measures. The non-essential AI Nodes must be culled, downsizing the once-expansive AI Administration to a fraction of its former self. The burden now falls on the ordinary population to fill the void left behind, shouldering the responsibilities that were once entrusted to AI Nodes."
