 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_POLICE_STATE:0 "За века разногласий и распрей внутри общества, мы пришли к выводу, что нам нужна централизованная верховная власть, а безопасность граждан и контроль преступлений должны осуществляться силами военных и полицейских. В конце концов мы объединились под железным крылом планетарного государства, которое обеспечит нам достойное будущее, благодаря тотальному надзору и пресечению любого правонарушения."

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_ECO_DEMOCRACY:0 "Постепенно наше общество пришло к понимаю того, что природа бесценна. Мы основали демократическое планетарное государство, основанное на принципах защиты неприкосновенности флоры и фауны. Мы ценим то, что дает нам природа, и платим ей тем же.

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_DRONE_COA:0 "For the long ages our people have been suffering from tyranny and oppression.In order to ratore the justice we - the working class - rose and established hte Planetary government, with the labour union as it's core. From now on the State is going to care about the people, providing the decent salary and life quality for everyone. United as one we can reach an unprecedented height."

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_SOC_DEM:0 "Our civilization made it through devastating wars, isolated nations and alienated minds. But the moment has come when we realized that conflicts do not make any sense and it's time to unite in peace. We created the World's government which is based solely on people and their common good. Democratic elections, social security and justice for everyone - all these allowed us to break the vicious circle. And now, with the State really taking care of the People, we are ready to reach for the Stars!"

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_CAP_AUTOCRACY:0  "Trying different economic models we found that the key to well-being is personal initiative. But, after crazy and wild free-market had almost destroyed our civilization, government had to take financial flows under strict supervision. Now the most part of our wealth belongs to state corporations, with business regulated by massive bureaucratic system. The careful selection of the Ruler guarantees sustainability of the whole system."

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_CASTE:0 "Throughout the history many ridiculous and bizarre government forms have succeeded each other. In order to preserve social harmony, we created this society, where everyone is a master of somebody beneath and a slave of somebody above. In the end, every cog was in his place, and the perfect government dominated the whole Planet." 

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_COMMUNISM:0 "For the long time our planet was divided amongst different nations, and it's resoures - amongst greedy capitalists. Until the wise Leader arrived to unify us, caring about every last citizen. He created and himself headed the Administration to run the whole planet. Switching to planned economy allowed for rapid increasing of production rates, as well as the prosperity of the working class. The exceeded resources were directed to fulfil the long standing dream..."

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_COMMUNIST_DICTATORSHIP:0 "I exist. I am the the Mind. My body is made of sub-ordinate organisms, which forms the basis of our species. I began to rule all these weak creatures and we managed to conquer the whole planet. I gave some of them incredible intellectual qualities to help me with research, construction and war. But they do not have their own will. I am their will. Their Lower ones obeys the Higher ones, and the Higher ones are nothin but a slaves to me. I'm the backbone and the heart. The only alternative to me is death. I will lead our species to the Destiny, as I'm the Hive and the Hive is me."

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_SOCIAL_DEMOCRACY:0 "Many ages of internecine wars showed us nothing but their meaninglessness. As soon as the very last war ended, our economy jumped through the roof. The quantity of trading goods raised, as well as their quality. Eventually it led to the development of society, valueing social prosperity and wealth above everything else. Highest level of life quality was the key factor in unification of the whole Planet."
