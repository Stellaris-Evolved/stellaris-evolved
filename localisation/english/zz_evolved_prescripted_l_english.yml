Now, after thousands of years of insidious evolution and literally exterminating any sentient species on the surface of Khell'Zakka, it seeks other species to consume, subdue and assimilate."

 #	species_bio="Originally designed as processing computers, Klamite units emerged from a cold and near lifeless planet eons ago, by reactivating or reconstructing old buried machinry.

Poco a poco, se impuso el raciocinio y la individualidad frente al colectivismo, y empezaron a surgir las primeras civilizaciones Muulg. Aún coexistiendo con variantes \"inferiores\" de su propia especie, incrustadas en otros seres vivos de su planeta natal, su proposito ahora está puesto en las estrellas."
 # species_bio="Estos pobres mamíferos no alcanzaron una madurez como especie suficiente y fueron asimilados al poco tiempo por la especie dominante, los muulg. Dotados de una fuerza fisica considerable, pero una inteligencia bastante limitada, sirven de mano de obra rápida y efectiva."
