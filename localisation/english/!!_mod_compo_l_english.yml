This seems to be an effort to defend their territory, of which they seem to be highly protective. Thus to see a worm, and live to tell about it, might be a rarity in itself. The sandworms are extremely territorial; as soon as two worms sense each other's presence, they let out chuffing roars of challenge, bellowing melange-smelling exhaust from their cavernous throats. Despite all the potential danger, the spice must flow, so settlements and colonist are equipped with special sound deflectors, making the worms docile and harmless."

During the night they glow as a means to attract other carnivorous flies as a part of their mating ritual, which seems to be quite complex. During the day they fly around looking for food.\nBeing carnivorous, they tend to swarm their prey and eat it alive in a matter of hours. Large, or small, all creatures are food for them. What makes it even worse is their colony like behavior, allowing them to navigate complex tunnels.. or vents! The fact that they emit no noise to even warn their next meal is the worst part, but natural repels made for colonist and settlements are a effective way to deal with this problem."
