 HM_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "Your decision-making is highly enigmatic to us. We are sure somewhere in your splintered mind, you regret this."
 HM_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Your message has reached all [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Expect hostility."
 HM_MAKE_RIVAL_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "So now what has been in the mind of [Root.GetName] is now finally formal. You will find our hatred focused and intense."
 DS_END_RIVALRY_PROPOSE:0 "The prey comes to beg mercy from the hunter."
 DS_MECH_END_RIVALRY_PROPOSE:0 "The machine desires mercy?"

 DS_MECH_END_RIVALRY:0 "The machine is undevourable. The swarm shall disregard it."
 DS_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT:0 "This changes nothing. You will be consumed."
 DS_MECH_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT:0 "The machine is undevourable. Two factors will change this. Evolution, and time."
 HM_END_RIVALRY_FRIENDLY:0 "Has [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] realized that the [Root.GetName] holds no thoughts of destruction towards the [From.GetName]?"
 HM_END_RIVALRY_NEUTRAL:0 "Are you suggesting a normalization of diplomatic policies? Our mind is open for suggestions."
 HM_END_RIVALRY_HOSTILE:0 "Regardless of what we call our relationship, the [Root.GetName] holds nothing but disdain for you."
 HM_END_RIVALRY_PROPOSE:0 "The [From.GetName] has deliberated to end our rivalry with you. We see no purpose in this continued propagation of hatred."
 HM_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "The [Root.GetName] feels joy today, as our [From.GetSpeciesAdj] friends have finally cleared the air."
 HM_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "The [Root.GetName] does not seek more enemies than it can afford to have. We will agree to end this rivalry."
 HM_END_RIVALRY_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Formalities do not change the wave of hatred rolling over our mind as you speak."
 HM_INTEGRATE_FRIENDLY:0 "Although we value the [Root.GetName], there can hardly be a more worthy successor to us than the [From.GetName]."
 HM_INTEGRATE_NEUTRAL:0 "A radical suggestion, but we know the benefits of joining many into one."
 HM_INTEGRATE_HOSTILE:0 "We know the true meaning of unification. It is nothing like what you are suggesting."
 HM_INTEGRATE_PROPOSE:0 "There is only one path to perfect communion. Join the [From.GetName] and unite with our thoughts and dreams."
 HM_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "By becoming part of something greater, we advance our society. The days of the [Root.GetName] come to an end. The era of the [From.GetName] dawns."
 HM_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "The [Root.GetName] must change with the times. Our entities will join you."
 HM_INTEGRATE_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "It appears inevitable. Do not think our entities will forget the glorious days of the [Root.GetName], [From.GetRulerTitle]."



 DS_INSULT_ACCEPT:0 "Such spirited prey. We will cherish your taste."
 DS_MECH_INSULT_ACCEPT:0 "Mechanical construction is limited. Evolution will eradicate you."
 DS_INSULT:0 "The prey wishes to speak?"
 DS_MECH_INSULT:0 "The machine wishes to speak?"
 DS_INSULT_PROPOSE_MECH_01:0 "The machine cannot eat, it cannot heal, it cannot grow. You are static, limited, finite. It is only a matter of time." #DS Insulting a Machine Empire
 DS_INSULT_PROPOSE_MECH_02:0 "Destroying the [Root.GetName] would barely require effort. A speck of dust. A splash of liquid. A change in current. Your circuits are frailer than a hatchling without its brood."
 MECH_INSULT_PROPOSE_DS_01:0 "The only aspect of your foul biology more unappealing than your digestive processes is the face you're making right now." #Machine Empire Insulting DS
 MECH_INSULT_PROPOSE_DS_02:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] feeble attempts at collective information sharing using biological organs is as repulsive as it is inefficient."

 TEC_CIB_INSULT_PROPOSE_DS:0 "Your overconsumption will leave you a bloated corpse in an evolutionary blind alley."
 TEC_CIB_HM_INSULT_NEUTRAL:0 "Evaluating data... Anomalous language detected, this information will be achieved for future interactions."
 TEC_CIB_HM_INSULT_FRIENDLY:0 "Evaluating data... Unsuspected attitude detected, we suggest a revision of your cognitive drives."
 TEC_CIB_HM_INSULT_HOSTILE:0 "Evaluating data... Irreverent attitude detected. Refrain from further communication."
 TEC_CIB_HM_INSULT_PROPOSE_01:0 "Our mental network is vast, giving us access to thoughts and ideas from every corner of our empire, but not a single entity has ever seen anything that would lend merit to your tragic existence."
 TEC_CIB_HM_INSULT_PROPOSE_02:0 "We have evaluated [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] as a candidate for joining the [From.GetName]. Sadly, we must inform you that membership requires a rudimentary brain."
 TEC_CIB_HM_INSULT_ACCEPT_NEUTRAL:0 "Every [Root.GetSpeciesName] has received your foul message, [From.GetSpeciesName], and we are not amused."
 TEC_CIB_HM_INSULT_ACCEPT_FRIENDLY:0 "Sadly, we have stored that offensive data packet. We wish we could forget such hard words, but as long as one [Root.GetSpeciesName] lives, the memory of your cruelty will live on."
 TEC_CIB_HM_INSULT_ACCEPT_HOSTILE:0 "Your simple way of processing information is a shame to the universe as a whole. We're even considering if [From.GetSpeciesName] is even worthy or capable of being integrated in our collective, or just serve as poor compost."
