# should_ai_use_job_micro = yes has some peculiarities, specifically job_changes
# if two job_changes are available at same time, only one is used...
# so you need to gate them in case they either reach full increase

# use `tec_can_reduce_job_further = { job = <job> }` and
# `tec_can_increase_job_further = { job = <job> }` to gate the job_changes
